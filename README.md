# EIS
The (New &amp; Better On-Line) Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, (NBOL)EIS

The great http://OEIS.org, to which I have devoted quite some time for over a dozen years now, suffers from several drawbacks and missed opportunities to go to a further stage beyond the current v.2.0 which is wiki but still static, and lacks systematic ordering of sequences

The (NBOL)EIS aims to remedy these shortcomings.

Some of the features:

* sequences will be systematically named and classified, based on [ideas of my own](naming.md),
and maybe also complexity classes as inspired by http://www.mrob.com/pub/math/MCS.html

* for many of the standard classes (e.g., all linear recurrent sequences) the encyclopedia ensures automatic dynamic creation of data (sequence terms), formulas, programs, cross-referencing and indexing.

...and a lot more! ;-) (Under construction!)
